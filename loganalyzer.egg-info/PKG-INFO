          - Pass in Width 
          - Pass in Length
          - Pass Counting in 9 determined Regions(A, B, ... I)
          - Pass Acuracy 
          - Pass Interception
          - True Pass 
        - Shoot count
          - Shoot in Width 
          - Shoot in Length
          - Shoot Counting in 9 determined Regions(A, B, ... I)
          - On Target Shoot
          - Off Target Shoot
          - Shoot Acuracy 
        - Possession 
          - Possession in 9 determined Regions(A, B, ... I)
          - Possession in 9 determined Regions for each player(A, B, ... I)
          - Possesion on defined reigons
        - Position 
          - Cycles Player is in 9 determined Regions(A, B, ... I)
        - Distance Each Player Moved
        - Stamina Each Player Used
        - Stamina per Distance for each player
        - Kick count
        - Tackle count
        - say count
        ### How to Use
        #### As a Script
            loganalyzer --path <log file without .rcl or .rcg >
        #### As a Module
            import loganalyzer
            from loganalyzer import Parser
            from loganalyzer import Game
            from loganalyzer import Analyzer
            parser = Parser('path to log file without .rcl or .rcg')
            game = Game(parser)
            analyzer = Analyzer(game)
            analyzer.analyze()
            left_team_pass = analyzer.pass_l 
            left_team_in_target_shoot = analyzer.in_target_shoot_l 
            left_team_agent_1 = game.left_team.agents[0].data
